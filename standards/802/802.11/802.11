3. Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations

    3.1 Definitions

        (1) access point (AP): An entity that contains one station (STA) and provides access to the distribution
                services, via the wireless medium (WM) for associated STAs.

        (2) basic service area (BSA): The area containing the members of a basic service set (BSS). It might contain
                members of other BSSs.

        (3) basic service set (BSS): A set of stations (STAs) that have successfully synchronized using the JOIN
                service primitives14 and one STA that has used the START primitive. Alternatively, a set of STAs that have
                used the START primitive specifying matching mesh profiles where the match of the mesh profiles has been
                verified via the scanning procedure. Membership in a BSS does not imply that wireless communication with
                all other members of the BSS is possible.

        (4) basic service set (BSS) transition: A station (STA) movement from one BSS to another BSS in the same
                extended service set (ESS).

        (5) BSS Max idle period: A time period during which the access point (AP) does not disassociate a station
                (STA) due to nonreceipt of frames from that STA.

        (6) channel: An instance of communications medium use for the purpose of passing protocol data units (PDUs)
                between two or more stations (STAs).

        (7) channel spacing: The difference between the center frequencies of two nonoverlapping and adjacent
                channels of the radio transmitter.

        (8) contention-free period (CFP): The time period during the operation of a point coordination function (PCF)
                when the right to transmit is assigned to stations (STAs) solely by a point coordinator (PC), allowing frame
                exchanges to occur between members of the basic service set (BSS) without contention for the wireless
                medium (WM).

        (9) contention period (CP): The time period outside of the contention-free period (CFP) in a point-coordinated
                basic service set (BSS). In a BSS where there is no point coordinator (PC), this corresponds to the entire
                time of operation of the BSS.

        (10) extended service area (ESA): The area within which members of an extended service set (ESS) can
                communicate. An ESA is larger than or equal to a basic service area (BSA) and might involve several basic
                service sets (BSSs) in overlapping, disjointed, or both configurations.

        (11) extended service set (ESS): A set of one or more interconnected basic service sets (BSSs) that appears as a
                single BSS to the logical link control (LLC) layer at any station (STA) associated with one of those BSSs.

        (12) extended service set (ESS) transition: A station (STA) movement from one basic service set (BSS) in one
                ESS to another BSS in a different ESS.

        (13) transmitted basic service set identifier (BSSID): The BSSID included in the MAC Header transmitter
                address field of a Beacon frame when the multiple BSSID capability is supported.

        (14) destination mesh station (STA): A mesh STA that is the final destination of a MAC service data unit
                (MSDU). This mesh STA might reside in a proxy mesh gate that might forward the MSDU to a STA outside
                of the MBSS. A destination mesh STA might be an end station as defined in IEEE Std 802.1.

    3.3 Abrrevitions and acronyms

        (1) AIFS:  arbitration interframe space
        (2) AIFSN: arbitration interframe space number
        (3) CW:    contention window



4. General description

    4.3 Components of the IEEE 802.11 architechture

        4.3.7 QoS BSS: The QoS network

            For infrastructure BSS and IBSS, this standard provides two mechanisms for the support of applications
            with QoS requirements.

            (1) EDCA(enhanced distributed channel access): delivers traffic based on
                    differentiating user priorities (UPs). This differentiation is achieved by varying the following for different
                    UP values:

                a. Amount of time a STA senses the channel to be idle before backoff or transmission, or
                b. The length of the contention window to be used for the backoff, or
                c. The duration a STA may transmit after it acquires the channel.

            (2) HCCA ( hybrid coordination function (HCF) controlled channel access): allows for the reservation of transmission 
                    opportunities (TXOPs) with the hybrid coordinator(HC).
